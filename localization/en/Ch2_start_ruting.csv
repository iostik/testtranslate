,A_c230c770,"A ""Well, yes. Hey, I've got an equally important task, to satisfy the Mistress's hunger, and that's not done by just going into her chambers, I will need to use my entire arsenal. You'll manage somehow.""",,,,,
,S_c8a50c5c,"S ""Yeah right, tell me you're not happy about it.""",,,,,
,A_ff3bf099,"A ""Heh, I am, but if I had a choice between you two, I would have dealt with your mutation properly.""",,,,,

,C_78226639,"C ""(If you are talking about fear, then I do not feel anything in this vein. If you have not forgotten, I am not burdened with emotions, and not just me. Many in the Swarm do not feel fear or other feelings.)""",,,,,

,C_09fc6cd2,"C ""(As far as I know, nobody is going to touch your mind and consciousness, those are you most valuable traits, by the standards of the Swarm, of course. I don’t take boobs into account.)""",,,,,

Well, my position here is simple, if they make my carrier stronger, I'll only be glad, because as you might understand, we are in the same boat. You are stronger, I am stronger.)""",,,,,
,C_567f3f1f,"C ""(I'm not talking about the opportunities that will open before us. If everything goes as it should, you will not only become stronger, you will become more universal.

,narrator_2feaa901,"""Something inside Sarah was pushing her forward, closer to her destination. Sarah blamed it at simple curiousity, but it was something much more significant that Sarah could comprehend yet.""",,,,,
,narrator_884bab7b,"""The small corridor seemed endless to her. For a moment, Sarah thought that she hadn’t moved at all until she felt a gloomy, heavy and at the same time bewitching atmosphere.""",,,,,
,narrator_b0b2d3a4,"""Before Sarah, an amazing sight was opening. In a dark room, right in the center of it was an immense cocoon that Sarah had never seen in her life. She had seen enough of everything in her life, but this sight struck the girl from the first instant. Despite the depressing sensation, Sarah could not tear her gaze from it.""",,,,,
,S_f8cacd92,"S ""Sai'mon, what is it... these are all... Roots? Or the branches of that... Plants? I've never seen anything like this in my life. At the same time frightening and bewitching.""",,,,,

,C_56399e1e,"C ""(I see, you quickly adapted.)""",,,,,
,S_9439d28d,"S ""This is all due to ambiguities. When it came to 'improvements', not the most favorable memories came over me... And imagining how it should be with the Swarm, the picture only got worse.""",,,,,

,S_b5841586,"S ""Don’t be conceited, one beautiful thing cannot cover all those nasty things that you do.""",,,,,
,narrator_b411eaba,"""Approaching closer to the center, Sarah with great curiosity examined what was in the room. From time to time looking under her feet.""",,,,,
,S_1f53aa78,"S ""His spikes are so big...""",,,,,
,narrator_399c242b,"""Passing another vine thing, Sarah quietly ran a finger along one of them and completed the inspection by touching the tip. Scarlet blood instantly appeared on the girl’s finger.""",,,,,

,C_ceecc1e3,"C ""(In this we are similar, you also adapt to everything, it just takes time.)""",,,,,
,S_3773240d,"S ""... by your logic, many interesting conclusions can be drawn. A monkey and a man both have penises, so they are similar.""",,,,,

,S_bc19e067,"S ""Yeah yeah, better tell me what else do you know about this plant?""",,,,,

,S_02cd8a5a,"S ""Wow...""",,,,,

,C_d74a426f,"C ""(The most interesting thing is that chrysalis can increase and decrease in size, if necessary right during the improvement.)""",,,,,

,S_42e35821,"S ""But... It doesn't look very safe.""",,,,,
,narrator_34d7f771,"""Sarah continued to watch the chrysalis from the side. It moved and reacted to Sarah's movement. If Sarah took a step forward, the chrysalis moved slower. She reminded Sarah of a heart in which life was in full swing. When Sarah came very close, the chrysalis completely froze, barely moving.""",,,,,
,S_0ef1447e,"S ""It can recognize movement on the outside?""",,,,,

,C_853beab4,"C ""(You underestimate the zerg, we would never have entrusted an important process to an invention that cannot protect itself.

,S_25c144dc,"S ""I feel so peaceful next to it... and it seems like I'm overwhelmed with strength, is that its effects?""",,,,,
,C_73481ca4,"C ""(Yes, that's right, you feel the vibrations it makes, the process of mutation requires a lot of resources, and one of the most important is psi-energy, which it absorbs through the environment, in this case from the Swarm.)""",,,,,
,S_392d08a2,"S ""Absorbs energy? This is so strange. It absorbs it and nourishes what's inside... me. """,,,,,
,C_7c461e12,"C ""You could say that. It itself needs not only energy but also biomass to exist, but it must also support your life. Inside it, you will be very vulnerable, as you will be unconscious. That is why the zerg made it so strong.""",,,,,

,narrator_00e3478c,"""Sarah touched the chrysalis with her fingertips, slowly placing her entire palm on it. Heat spread throughout her body, allowing Sarah to feel all the energy that was seething in this cocoon. By concentrating, Sarah could feel the psi energy of the zerg near her. This was different from the usual connection with the Swarm, which shocked the girl’s mind. The chrysalis moved, pulsed and continued to sparkle with a golden light, bewitching Sarah with its beauty.""",,,,,
,S_e7c49f67,"S ""I feel it... all this energy flowing through it... I feel the Swarm and so very simply... Is that that energy?""",,,,,
